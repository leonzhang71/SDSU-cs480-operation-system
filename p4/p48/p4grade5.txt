This is a **preliminary** test of your upcoming Program 4.

This message, which will appear to be mailed from your account, is intended to
show you some (but not necessarily all) of the checks that will be made on your
assignment when the due date actually arrives.  This is NOT the actual version
that will be graded, but only an attempt to give you early warning of any
potential problems.  Point totals in the final graded version may differ.

[Standard Disclaimer:]
These practice tests are intended to show bugs, but also to reveal places
where you may not be following all the automatic grader's nitpicking
requirements.  If you receive failure warnings on the preliminary tests
and then also have difficulty during the graded event, you have very little
recourse.  To take full advantage of the feedback provided in this course,
you must do the assignments in a timely fashion.

Checking Program 4: 38/39
Remember, the GradeEarly file will be used to decide if you are FINISHED.
If the GradeEarly file is present at the extra-credit deadline,
your program will be considered 'submitted', with NO further chance for
modifications.  Checking if the GradeEarly file exists:
ls -l ~cssc0094/Two/GradeEarly
-rw------- 1 cssc0094 carroll 0 Sep 21 19:26 /home/cs/carroll/cssc0094/Two/GradeEarly
If this were the extra credit deadline (11pm Saturday, 11/27/21),
the autograder WOULD collect your program.

Test 3... Checking for some prescribed/proscribed features;
a human will have to look over the output from the grep commands...

Are you defining a character buffer large enough to handle MANY 'long' words?
egrep -n '#define|STORAGE' p2.h p2.c
p2.h:18:#define MAXITEM 100 /* max number of words per line */
p2.h:19:#define PROMPT_STRING ":480:"
p2.c:71:#define EACCES
p2.c:75:#define ENOENT
p2.c:79:#define ENOTDIR
p2.c:256:    char w[STORAGE];

Are you using the proper system calls to implement 'ls-F' as a built-in?
egrep -n 'readdir|opendir|stat' p2.c
46: *, the extern int variable errno will be charge. I set up statement to find which
59:#include <sys/stat.h>
498:        dirp = opendir(cmds[0].cmd_args[i]);
524:            if ((dp = readdir(dirp)) != NULL) {
525:                struct stat s;
529:                if (lstat(path, &s) < 0) {
530:                    perror("lstat");
537:                    if (stat(path, &s) < 0) {
655:static int run_other_cmds(int i, int fds[])

Are children being terminated with the correct signal?
egrep -n 'SIG|setpg|signal|terminated' p2.c
15: *the signal handling like 'echo hi > filename.'
36: *child processes exits or a signal is recevied. For vertical pipe, we have to do
50:#include <signal.h>
64:#include <signal.h>
156:    // printf("Received SIGTERM (%d), and the special handler is running...\n", signum);
163:    if (setpgid(0, 0) < 0) {
164:        perror("setpgid");
167:   (void)signal(SIGTERM,myhandler);
168:   // signal(SIGTERM, myhandler);
199:    killpg(getpgrp(), SIGTERM);
200:    printf("p2 terminated.\n");

Is the parent waiting for a child?  ...For the CORRECT child?
egrep -n 'wait|while' p2.c
34: *'two' fork() for two pid which mean parent will create two children. Using wait
35: *system call in c. A call to wait() blocks the calling process until one of its
60:#include <sys/wait.h>
523:        while(dirp) {
638:    // wait child
640:        int tpid = wait(NULL);
643:                perror("wait");
649:    // printf("wait child %d success\n", pid);
717:                pid_t tpid = wait(NULL);
719:                    // perror("wait");
786:                pid_t tpid = wait(NULL);
788:                    // perror("wait");
797:        pid_t tpid = wait(NULL);
799:            // perror("wait");

grep -n void p2.c
18: *void reset(): reset everything to null or 0, so the program will reset everything
21: *void showprompt(): print the prompt
118:void reset();
120:void showprompt();
126:void run_test();

167:   (void)signal(SIGTERM,myhandler);
206:void reset()
243:void showprompt()
405:void run_test()

Are you ensuring that background children don't compete for keyboard input?
grep -n /dev/null p2.c
592:                fpath = "/dev/null";

Are you ensuring that children inherit only empty buffers?
egrep -n 'fork|fflush' p2.c
14: *of the command is made inside the child of a fork. Furthermore, the program use
34: *'two' fork() for two pid which mean parent will create two children. Using wait
248:    fflush(stdout);
580:    if ((pid = fork()) < 0) {
581:        perror("fork");
692:        // fork
693:        pid_t pid = fork();
695:            perror("fork");
732:    pid_t pid = fork();
734:        perror("fork error");
747:        // fork
748:        pid_t pid2 = fork();
750:            perror("fork error");

Do all children exit() upon failure?
egrep -n 'execvp|exit|dup2|open|CHK|perror' p2.c
30: *int run_single_cmd(): similar idea for dup2.c. First, we have to open the file to
31: *see that it is exist or not. Also, we have to use dup2 to a file which open for
32: *the output. We don't want to have both file descriptors open, so close()
36: *child processes exits or a signal is recevied. For vertical pipe, we have to do
67://#include "CHK.h"

What (if anything) are you passing to parse?
grep -n parse( p2.c
22: *int parse(): this part is going to find the metacharacter. Therefore, I use the
122:int parse();
181:        parse();
252:int parse()

Calls to system() are NOT being used, right?:
grep -n system p2.c
10: *This program is a command line interperter for Unix system, and it acts like shell.
35: *system call in c. A call to wait() blocks the calling process until one of its

Test 4... is p2.c documented?
(Your p2.c documentation does NOT have to repeat all the specs for p2,
but it should list your name, instructor name [NOTE: 'Carroll' contains
two 'R's and two 'L's], class [that is, 'CS480'], due date, etc.)
A brief synopsis and guidance at decision points / tricky issues will suffice.
You may LOSE a point here if it keywords are missing; your total is now 0/0
(Many more points depend on your documentation, but a human will have to
assign the remaining documentation points.)

Test 5... how is the syntax?
make splint
splint -warnposix +trytorecover -weak getword.c p2.c
Splint 3.1.2 --- 11 Oct 2015

p2.c: (in function run_ls_F)
p2.c:500:28: Parse Error. Attempting to continue.
p2.c:500:28: Cannot recover from parse error.
*** Cannot continue.
make: *** [splint] Error 1

splint encountered an unrecoverable error     ERROR    ERROR    ERROR    ERROR
YOU LOSE A POINT HERE; your total is now -1/0

NOTE: not everything that 'splint' comments about is necessarily a bad thing;
for example, splint may complain if you don't save the value that printf()
returns (even if this may be a perfectly reasonable thing to ignore).

Test 6... Does the gradernotes file exist?
Yes.
Your gradernotes file contains:

1:I lose one point from 'make splint', and I think I put all variables on the top of each block.
2:I tried to move all variables to top of each block, but my program will display
3:the wrong output for me.
4:
5:I believe everthing work except 'amke splint'.
6:I wrote this code by myself.
7:
8:I copy the code 'strdup' function from the internet since 'make splint' shows
9:it is an undeclared identifier.
10:link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40766055/error-strdup-was-not-declared-in-this-scope
11:
12:USEFUL help from edoras like 'man errno'. Helping me how to use errno
13:
14:cite code:
15:fork1.c,exec1.c, fork2.c pipe.c,dup.c, dup2.c, sig.c, sighandler,c,dir.c, stat.c.

You may LOSE a point here if it doesn't exist; your total is now -1/0
(Note that TWO required statements belong in this file; also list your design
decisions here [see the 'checklist' below for samples of what to include .]
A human grader will check this later, and perhaps adjust your score.)

Test 7... are the makefile and getword.h soft links in place?
ls -l ~cssc0094/Two/makefile ~cssc0094/Two/getword.h
lrwxrwxrwx 1 cssc0094 carroll 36 Sep 21 19:28 /home/cs/carroll/cssc0094/Two/getword.h -> /home/cs/faculty/cs480/One/getword.h

makefile is correctly linked.
getword.h is correctly linked.
If you don't have the right setup, you could LOSE a point here;
                                       Your total is now -1/0

Test 8... are the proper .h files included in your source code?
One more point was possible here; your total is now 0/1
(If you are failing this test, just #include all the .h files for the system
calls recommended for program2, even if you are not yet using all those calls.)
There are (at least) 9 header files that you will need.
And of course, if you're using non-recommended calls, make sure you have the
proper .h files for those, too.

Test 9... does your program compile?
make clean; make
rm -f *.o p2
gcc -g   -c -o getword.o getword.c
gcc -g   -c -o p2.o p2.c
gcc -o p2 getword.o p2.o
[1] 32047

Test 10... does your program use ';' as a command separator?
Here is the result of ~cssc0094/Two/p2 < ~cs480/Data4/input1 :

Your output was:
:480: Null
:480: voiD
:480: p2 terminated.

The correct output is:
Null
voiD
:480: :480: :480: p2 terminated.

Parent/child output could get interleaved, but that's still correct behavior.

Three more points were possible here; your total is now 3/4

Some notes about the [odd-looking] correct output:
Your shell was run using: ~cssc0094/Two/p2 < ~cs480/Data4/input1
Due to the above redirection, we do not see any input commands, we only
see what your process outputs.  If you are following the specs, p2 should print
the prompt three times, followed by 'p2 terminated.', so
':480: :480: :480: p2 terminated.' is correct.
The child finishes first and therefore flushes his output buffer first, so the
child output will (usually) appear before the shell prompts in these tests.
...but this is NOT the order you should see when testing your p2 interactively.
NOTE: If your ':480: ' prompt prints the proper NUMBER of times, but is intermixed
with the other output, the autograder should still give you full credit; if not,
the most common reason is inexact punctuation (3 colons AND a period).

Test 11... does your program handle escaped metacharacters?
Here is the result of ~cssc0094/Two/p2 < ~cs480/Data4/input2 :

Your output was:
:480: rat ear|
:480: cac fac|
:480: p2 terminated.

The correct output is (note the extra spaces):
:480: rat ear|
:480: cac   fac|
:480: p2 terminated.

                    Child process produced reasonable output -- CONGRATULATIONS

Two more points were possible here; your total is now 5/6

Test 12... does 'cd' with no arguments work?
Here is the result of ~cssc0094/Two/p2 < ~cs480/Data4/input3 :
(I randomly set the HOME variable, so don't expect ~cssc0094 in the output.)

Your output was:
:480: :480: /usr/local/bin
:480: p2 terminated.

The correct output is:
/usr/local/bin
:480: :480: :480: p2 terminated.
(You can get full credit, even with parent and child output interleaved.)

One more point was possible here; your total is now 6/7

Test 13... does backgrounding work?
Here is the result of ~cssc0094/Two/p2 < ~cs480/Data4/input5 :

Your output was:
:480: Wed Nov 24 11:10:23 PST 2021

:480: :480: child =32092= begins sleep
Wed Nov 24 11:10:23 PST 2021
:480: child =32092= ends sleep
:480: p2 terminated.

Did you print the process name, a space, and '[' ? (i.e., '.../jabbersleepy [')
             /home/cs/faculty/cs480/jabbersleepy was printed -- CONGRATULATIONS

Did your shell print the correct child process ID, within '[' and ']' ?
                    Yes, the child PID inside [] was printed -- CONGRATULATIONS
Did the two 'date' commands get executed within the same second?
    Good, your shell did not wait for the background process -- CONGRATULATIONS

Three more points were possible here; your total is now 9/10

Test 14... do backgrounded zombies get reaped quickly?
Here is the result of ~cssc0094/Two/p2 < ~cs480/Data4/input88 :

Your output was:
:480: sleep [32134]
:480: :480: sleep [32135]
:480: :480: sleep [32136]
:480: :480: :480: foreground jobs should clear out all zombies...if you use
wait() correctly.

Test 15... does the shell wait for foreground children?
Here is the result of ~cssc0094/Two/p2 < ~cs480/Data4/input6 :

Your output was:

          Good, your shell waited for the foreground process -- CONGRATULATIONS
         Good, your shell handled the pipeline appropriately -- CONGRATULATIONS

Two more points were possible here; your total is now 11/12

Test 16... does your program redirect standard input?
Here is the result of ~cssc0094/Two/p2 < ~cs480/Data4/input7 :

The contents of stdout/stderr was:

Two more points were possible here; your total is now 13/14

Test 17... do pipelines and input/output redirection all work?
Here is the result of ~cssc0094/Two/p2 < ~cs480/Data4/input11 :

The contents of stdout/stderr was:
:480: echo [32212]
:480: first command
:480: p2 terminated.

The results of the redirected pipeline (in your.outputc) was:
ECHO NULL;ECHO          VOID

The proper file contents should be:
ECHO NULL;ECHO          VOID

              Pipeline redirected input/output from/to files -- CONGRATULATIONS

Three more points were possible here; your total is now 16/17

Test 18... does your program guard against buffer overruns?
(Note that every one of the strings you put in your argv[] array could
potentially contain 254 characters, so p2 needs a LARGE character buffer...
Here is the result of ~cssc0094/Two/p2 < ~cs480/Data4/input8 :

:480: :480: p2 terminated.
NOTE: examine your error messages below carefully; if you see repeated
messages that you did not expect, this is likely because the parent still had
the error message in its buffer, the forked child inherited this data, and then
both the parent and the child printed it.  You may have trouble reproducing
this effect in your own experiments, but fflush() is what you need to fix it.

Test 27... even more EXTRA CREDIT: does ls-F work with pipelines?
NOTE: ls-F does not read from stdin, so the only place it makes sense in a
pipeline is at the beginning (the far left). Don't worry about other placements.

Test 28...  one more Easter Egg: ls-F in program4 was supposed to handle
multiple arguments, but I haven't been testing for that.  So if you're actually
doing that correctly, you can get yet another EXTRA CREDIT point here:
I'll (silently) try ~cssc0094/Two/p2 < ~cs480/Data4/input17 :
config
                 Great.  /etc/w3m/config was reported by ls-F.  CONGRATULATIONS
One more point was possible here; your total is now 39/39
(The denominator (39) didn't change, because this was an EXTRA CREDIT test.)

The assignment will be worth 44 points (after a human grades it).

Test 29... no points, just a way of checking if vertical piping is implemented.
Examine the output of the ps command below carefully.  If you are doing vertical
piping correctly, EACH 'sleep' process will have a different parent (shown in
the PPID column).  If so, relax -- you're doing things right.

But if several children report the SAME parent, this is horizontal piping.
The autograder is too dumb to check this effectively, so it may be reporting a
MUCH higher score than is warranted.

If you fail to do vertical piping, it [negatively] affects your grade.  A human
(me) will have to sadly demolish your piping points when I grade the printouts.

Your grade for this assignment will be determined by a (human) grader
at the due date.
The automation currently only tests 39 out of the total 44 points;
a human will determine whether you have earned the remaining 5 points,
and if you miss too much stuff on the checklist below, you'll LOSE some points.
(On the automated part, you scored 39/39.)
