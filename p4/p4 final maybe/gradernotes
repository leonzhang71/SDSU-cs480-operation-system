I lose one point from 'make splint', and I think I put all variables on the top of each block.
I tried to move all variables to top of each block, but my program will display 
the wrong output for me.

I believe everthing work except 'amke splint'.
I wrote this code by myself.

I copy the code 'strdup' function from the internet since 'make splint' shows 
it is an undeclared identifier.
